### müllos

a minimal and experimental x86_64 heapless unix-like OS von czjstmax. \
the name is based off the german word for trash. haha.

---

#### things
müllos uses the [limine bootloader](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine) because the [müll_bootloader](https://github.com/jstmaxlol/mullos/tree/master/.old/) sucked.

#### objectives

the objectives for müllos are to have:
- a C compiler work on it
- an integrated minimal userland shell.
- a simple filesystem
- multitasking
